# LabCamp
This repository contains the code for the RxSwift labcamp

The LabCamp is structered in exercises about reactive programming. Starting from InitialPageVC is possible to access the exercise view controllers. 
The InitialPageVC is a bit complex on purpose, it's better to understand its code before starting to write any code. 
Every view controller contains an exercise, you can complete them in any order.
